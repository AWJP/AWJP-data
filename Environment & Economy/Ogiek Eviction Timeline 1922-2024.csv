Intro page,The History of the Marginalization and Eviction of the Ogiek people of Kenya,"The land rights of the Ogiek people have been subjected to politics since the colonial era when the colonialists changed land ownership from communal to private or state. This has affected the Ogiek community who were forest dwellers and owned land communally, including conserving the forest which was part of their livelihood. This has made it difficult for the community to retain their forest as their ancestral land. The following is a narration of their marginalization and eviction over the past century.",https://ogiekpeoples.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Joyful-celebrations-1536x1024.jpg,Ogiek Community celebrating the 6th Anniversary of the Landmark Ruling by the ACHPR
1922,Eviction for White Settlers,The Ogiek were first evicted by the British colonial government after it occupied Kenya. They moved to other parts of the Mau forest in the Rift Valley and set up their lives again.,https://assets.survivalinternational.org/pictures/773/ken-ogiek-ys-2435ke15_1800.jpg,An Ogiek man prepares his bow and arrows.

1938,Another Eviction,"Another eviction came in 1938-1941, which forced them to move deeper into the Chepalungu Forest.",https://assets.survivalinternational.org/pictures/4022/ken-ogiek-ys-2435ke11_1800.jpg,The Ogiek’s forests are one of Africa’s key carbon sinks and a main source of water for Kenya’s rivers.

1946,Yet Another Eviction,"The next eviction took place between 1946 and 1948 to create more land for the White Settlers. The government by then had not demarcated the official forest boundaries, and as forest dwellers, the Ogiek liked to live deep into the forest.

1954,Mau Forest Declared a National Reserve,The forest was declared a national reserve which led to the Ogiek claiming exclusive ownership of the place and thus began a long battle with successive governments.,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1spzPN76CcJ_70CYz_FuaLZzD61n0YUMR/view?usp=drive_link,Mau Forest and tea plantations.

1963,Resettlement at Independence,"When Kenya gained independence from the British, the Ogiek were resettled in the now Ndoinet, Saino and Tinet areas. They were allowed to keep cattle, donkeys and sheep but not goats.",http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/46378000/gif/_46378128_kenya_mau01_466.gif,Mau Forest on the map. Image by BBC
1975,A Destructive Eviction,"When they thought all their problems were over, another painful eviction was carried out. This time, their houses were burnt and their livestock confiscated and auctioned by the government  at throwaway prices. Their women were mistreated and raped by the law enforcers, and the men unlawfully charged and detained. Due to the chaos arising from the eviction, many children were separated from their families and up to now their whereabouts remain unknown.

1993,Resettlement,"The Ogiek were to be allocated 25-acre piece of land per family, but matters changed as other communities were brought in to settle and this saw the land size reduced from 25 to 5 acres. The resettlement was also extended to include Mauche and Sirikwa areas.  ",https://assets.survivalinternational.org/pictures/109/ken-ogi-vl-04_460_landscape.jpg,Ogiek man. Image by Survival.
2002,Another Destructive Eviction,"They were repeatedy ordered to vacate the lands as they were within the forest area. This was as a result of a cutline drawn by the surveyors demarcating the forest boundary and those found to be within this cutline were required to move out.  As they had nowhere to go, they did not vacate the area. This saw the enforcement officers forcefully evict the community, burning houses and food stores, destroying crops in the farm, confiscating livestock and schools.",https://assets.survivalinternational.org/pictures/24583/Ogiek_house_burning_1800.jpg,An Ogiek house burned down during a previous series of evictions.

2009,A Turn to the Regional Courts,"The Ogiek people, through the Ogiek Peoples’ Development Programme (OPDP), filed a case against the Kenyan government for what they termed as a violation of their land and human rights. The case was lodged before the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights (ACHPR).",https://achpr.au.int/sites/default/files/images/2022-09/achpr-1.png,"ACHPR headquarters in Banjul, The Gambia.

2010,The Prime Ministers’ Brief on the Rehabilitation of the Mau Forest Complex,The Prime Ministers’ Brief on the Rehabilitation of the Mau Forest Complex report was released. It states that the secretariat organized workshops in 2009 and 2010 with the Ogiek community living in all parts of Mau Forest Complex in order to come up with a lasting solution to their problems and that the committee worked closely with the Ogiek Council of Elders to prepare a register of the Ogiek. The Ogiek deny that any register was taken. The report also states that the settlers were even assisted in rebuilding their lives. This is contrary to the Ogiek account; they say that they have never received any resettlement assistance from the government.  ,https://img.yumpu.com/24316647/1/500x640/mau-forest-complex-report-kenya-wildlife-service.jpg,Image from Government of Kenya

2023,New Threat Due to Carbon Credits,"Yet another wave of evictions began on November 2, affecting more than 1,000 of the Ogiek. The environment ministry said it was reclaiming parts of the Mau Forest from “encroachment and illegal logging activities”. The displaced Ogiek said most of their homes were torched by Kenya Forest Service officers. Members of the community have been scattered across the area and now live in makeshift structures made of donated nylon bags. It is suspected that the government is trying to increase the forest coverage to align with its interest in benefiting from the carbon credits that will be calculated from the forests.",https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2023/12/20154643/Ogiek-5.jpg,Esther Norparua and her daughters sit near her demolished houses. “Now we sit here all day.

2024,Uncertain Future,"More than a century later, the Ogiek people, who know no other home than the Mau Forest, have not been living in peace and have not been compensated for their losses nor resettled. The move to expand the carbon credits market in the Global South is expected to greatly increase the theft of Indigenous peoples’ lands; increase funding for violent fortress conservation projects; and will likely lead to many more waves of evictions.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J-o0H0eamuWAIoebtnj0E9jj_TvQdruT/view?usp=drive_link,"Ogiek people lead a donkey to the Mau Forest in the Rift Valley, about 200km (127 miles) to the southwest of Kenya's capital, Nairobi.
