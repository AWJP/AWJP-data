The Food Consumption Score (FCS) is the most commonly used food security indicator. It represents households' dietary diversity and nutrient intake. The FCS is calculated by inspecting how often households consume food items from the different food groups during a 7-day reference period.,,,,,,
Households with poor or borderline Food Consumption Score (proportion of households with insufficient food consumption),,,,,,
2020 Q2,This figure was relatively lower because WFP doubled rations in May-June after the 30% cut in Apri-June;,,,,,
2020 Q3,The survey is taken at the peak of harvest season (September) which lasts Aug-Dec,,,,,
