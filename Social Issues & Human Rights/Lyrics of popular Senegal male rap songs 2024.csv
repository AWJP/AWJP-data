"Keur Gui - Alma Noop Lyrics
Cliff
Tanale, my mother is doing well tcha, I'm going to take her to my father.
I am your father and I have not done what I should be punished for.
May you be inspired by the good people you have met.
Thank you for respecting your religion.
Your relationship with your peers is your male identity.
Don't let the winner want to get rid of you.
You're ready to sleep with the goat, you're fasting, the goat doesn't say anything.
He doesn't say no, if you do it differently.
Know your tribe, don't worry about what hurts you.
wethiet you need it but don't let it title you
Floppy disk will be your girlfriend and she will not be able to control you.
I know you're touching her pet use a condom.
I love parenting!
Fils and avoid vices, you guys are diss
The Prophet is reading, so beware of tarkhiss.
The one who starts doesn't steal, the ass doesn't steal.
Men Don't Steal, Men Don't Dance

THEATER
Girl, I don't want you to get mad at me, you know how much I love you.
Soumalay land is not because I'm always jealous of you
I know you're here, I don't want to hurt you.
A woman doesn't read pank, she reads leg.
The woman of Mouthiam is low, Diamono is low
The world is weird, full of weird people.
you know I do feel
Boy turned pedophile
Men can be so sweet, You'll hear it and still Je t'aime
Let's trust one sissa, Don't trust another one.
I treasure your life, I don't want your eyes to turn red.
Do not be afraid of the fountain, Soy teud na seur bi red.
Because that's your answer, your ears aren't being sold.
Don't listen to everyone, be happy with yourself, don't be happy with your neighbor.
It makes the gnor xomb, nothing will hurt you.
Be clear, easy to get, no one can pass you.

CLIFF
If you see me talking a lot, I'm not sure what to do.
Wadiour is not painful, I have to worry about it.
Otherwise, it will be destroyed.
Djiko loves you, he will always love you.
Whatever you give, make sure you don't lose it.
Blessed are the ears that hear your whistles.

THEATER
I've got you ready, where you're married you're married.
Your mother doesn't pay, she's dead, you pay her.
If you follow him, you'll be able to dress well, don't worry about who's looking at you.
Don't let anyone see you.
Marriage is your husband, be your husband.
Stay relaxed, what you don't want to lose."

"The African ft. Baaba Maal - Didier Awadi

...

I like it

Kick

(Hun Kolli kodaama Gonga haalama éé gallé)

Awadi Super Ndaanane international

I was born to a Beninese father

Toffinou de soava I had no choice

If we are proud of our roots we thank the father

But we do not forget the suffering of the mother

She gave me the melody of Boa Vista

We live melancholy, do not trivialize it

Child of the islands your destiny is linked to the sea

So you leave but you remain a child of Cape Verde

They went on an adventure it was not illegal

The path to happiness led them to Senegal

My mother in Rebeuss my father was in Casamance

But it is in Thiès, that we celebrated when I was born

That is why this continent is always in my texts

Whether I like it or not, his DNA is still in my head

This union made me the number one rapper

When Africa unites, it necessarily makes champions

Han Africa to ngondabo mi yetuma

(Call me African)

Mi yetuma, mi anduma, mi ndiarma

(Straight from akebuland)

Mi hamto, mi sapito, mi mijo

(Call me African)

Mi hamto, mi sapito, mimijo

(Straight from akebuland)

One certainty is that Africa is not destitute

Cheikh Amidou Kane told us that it is only disunited

We are blind, we do not want to see what unites us

We can not wait for the bastard to humiliate us

What they want, you must know, is to divide us

History is stubborn, it is there it must be revised

They must know, from now on the people are wise

Yesterday's enemy is still there, we're not going to argue

He has his sights set, a damn sharp blade

What he bet on is to better channel you

He talks about help, it's to better colonize you

The brain is in the head and its role is to analyze

That's why this continent is always in my lyrics

Whether I like it or not, its DNA is always in my head

This union has made me the number one rapper

When Africa unites, it necessarily makes champions

Han Africa to ngondabo mi yetuma

(Call me the African)


(Straight from akebuland)

Mi hamto, mi sapito, mi mijo

(Call me the African)
(ha ha Straight from akebuland) Han Han haha ​​(Call me African) Africata yinoma (Straight from akebuland) Djiadiame léla éé mberdam koydii nguégaamii yo (Call me African) Midjodji moussedi koodomi (I'm a Kamite From Akebuland) Mi hamto mi sapito mi midio Hankima... hankima sangayi sanga Ñaldé ñaladji Ñaldé Allahou Kéwi Kéwi kono potani Africa sayina han han (I come to listen on the other side)"
"I wonder, I wonder, I think

(Straight from akebuland)

(haha Call me African)

(ha ha Straight from Akebuland)

Han Han haha ​​(Call me the African)

Africata is either

(Straight from akebuland)

Djiadiame lela and my dreams are yours.

(Call moi the African)

Codomic Moussedi Midwives

(I am a Committee of Akebuland)

I wonder if I knew I midio

Attention... attention I don't get

Holidays

Allah's Day Happened

There's nothing wrong with African potatoes.

(I come to hear from the other side)"

What I see you doing is not your girlfriend.

What I mean is you're not sure.
I'm here to talk to you.
I don't run, I don't run.
Everyone assumes everything will be fine.
Ma-ak you can't be a big-and playful person.
Khamna who want to separate us.

Why are they so different?
Why are they so different?
Me and you for life my baby
If he comes to me, I won't cry.

Why are they so different?
Why are they so different?

Don't let your enemies triumph, they'll be fierce.

Me and you for life my baby
