"Sister Fa - Milyamba (English)

1. Verse
Well dressed this morning you go out to use your time 
You don't take your time to walk slowly as in spring 
You do not give so much importance to the ones who say 
That the life in the countryside is difficult 
Because you little Sister live the easy life 
To go shopping you have your nice car 
You drive with it like a small nightingale
Meanwhile me all morning I go to the rice fields 
With my child in my back I go kilometres 
Dressed in rags as if I had nothing else 
To live happy I have to accept this work 
For it I use all my energy without any sorrow 
And to prove my braveness I start a simpl croon

2. Verse
With the burning sun right in the middle of the day 
We brave women work there in fields
like slaves in one of these plantations 
We take care of our harvest with attention 
Avoiding to step on it, that is affection 
While you in your well air-conditioned room 
You make your siesta without risk to be traumatized 
While I think of it your room is well flavoured
And your curtains protect you from the sun 
Sleep well little Sister because you do not have any worries
The life which I live is the law of nature
My injured feet even tough wearing sandals 
Which I take off as soon as I arrive in front of my door 
A very small nearly empty bowl is all that they bring me 
And the fruit of my job is what I bring in.

3. Verse
My hard hands do not deny the contact with the mortar 
My body is damaged from my head up to my heels 
Certain dresses like trousers you never wear it 
The last sunrays I use them to preparer with sweat in my kitchen 
My running tears hurt my pride 
I work with naked upper part of the body even if it is a bit wild 
Work hard to nourish my children, that it is my work 
I have to do it before shame devastates me 
To have a rest I back out in my hut
My mat loopholed by thumbtacks and fleas till the soil
Which bite me all over my body and which prevent me to sleep."

Couple 1
You have shown me the way, and my burden is not heavy.
The bumpy road means I see
Fire up the courage and see what lies ahead and I'll get you there.
Job is my credo for prayer you must prostrate
Bakan doesn't believe you, everything is heavy, God will fix it.
The crooked road you were waiting for fils i’m sorry
The more I fight I don't see the laughter of the enemies.
Get out there, trust yourself, forget the enemies.
If you want to go out, you can add cereal.
Seeing your mother cry always ends the tears.
When you refuse, you burn the courage that believes that fight is worth it.
Thank goodness I am wise now and there is no fog.
 Refrain
I promise success will come to you success will come to you
please don't give up you will miss you you will miss you
I promise you the victory will come you the victory will come you don't give up you will never lose you will never lose you


√ Couple 2

Those who rely on the shape often make me multiply the allure
My hard case takes the courage to make armor.
Blinder my mind knows that this art is a hard fight.
It's a world so bow down and fight!
The darkness of your mind lights the torch of the city of light.
Those who believe in me have seen the victory and are lost.
Dream and see what I have passed and thank the king.
The roads are so hard I can't get lost it's all you
Today you are losing everything you are the one who used to accompany me without a cup or a bouder.
I promise you the city fight is working!
penetrated Europe and Asia and spread to New York.
 Refrain
I promise success will come to you success will come to you
please don't give up you will miss you you will miss you
I promise you victory will come you victory will come you don't give up you'll never lose you you'll never lose you
Hooks
The dark road I will dig through will fight.
The road is dark and I dig.
I promise to translate
Draw your heart you
Please don’t give up the fight I’m with you yes

"** The lyrics of Mamy Victory ""Kouy Feugeuti"" **

Couple 1
Someone is open and someone is closed.
Twenty-nine months old
CNG validates my birth.
All Guewel tagged me.
Here's my friend, I'm ready.
It's a pillow around my waist.
It should be able to meet the needs of a world that used to be full.
You must be able to solve problems.
It means pure pain that no one can change it.
The referee said prip they are protecting my supporters they are insulting
My promise is equal.
Choose Corpegn Thiaxabal.
He shaved his sole and I loved him.
I blocked it out yesterday.
Reporters asked who was angry with him.
The enemy says we are sniffing.
Wadji the only bot
I'm sure the one who asks is not a sekeut.
If you have sass, I'll send you to Mom's house.
He looked like he was telling me to run out of the bags.

Refrain
Who's flying who's flying
The one who is fighting who he is The one who is fighting
Ignition expenses Water and electricity fires.
How you need someone to stop and install the snow.
Who's flying who's flying
The one who is fighting is someone who is fighting.
Scholarship fire disease healed fire
How you need someone to stop and install the snow.

Couple 2
Oufou my lamb cover I don't want anything
The referee called again and my strength was left.
What all serignes say is that I found it
The whole staff said today is my day.

(Additional vocals by Elaj Keïta)
Wathie I used to not fear someone who used to jump on you.
Beuré them helper helper
You win or we win you)

Wadji raised his guard and forced him to fight.
He entered me and I was so tired that he rianiane me waaf
I'm sure he's going to be able to fall out quickly.
The referee says the referee didn't want to show me that it was a right kick.
Same geum geum gui started screaming
I can bring victory to my country.
When I tried to step on the ice, I thought the lamb was gone.
Because the rothiékou is covered with snow.
Gal gal I reup new appui light
Then he covered my ear and told me that the time was right.
The world is yours every day when you have your needs met.

Refrain
Who's flying who's flying
The one who is fighting who he is The one who is fighting
Ignition expenses Water and electricity fires.
How you need someone to stop and install the snow.
Who's flying who's flying
The one who is fighting is someone who is fighting.
Scholarship fire disease healed fire
How you need someone to stop and install the snow."
