Domestic Workers Legislation,,
,,
"Employment
Contracts",Types,"AsinDomesticWorkersConvention,2011(No.189),the
Employment and Labour Relations Act of Tanzania also provides
for oral and written contracts of employment with a caveat
that even for oral contracts of employment, some terms and
conditions of employment must be in writing. Similarly, the
Employment Act of Zanzibar recognizes both written and oral
contracts although it limits the length of an oral contract not
to exceed six months. Domestic workers may enter into any
category of the employment contracts."
,Practice,"In this Situational Analysis, 80 percent of domestic workers
interviewed were unsure of the employment relationship in the
sense of the type of contract they have with their employers
because they had no contract, or never talked about terms with
employers. This is irrespective of the legal requirement that
some of the terms and conditions of employment must be kept
in writing and the employee must be served with the copy of
the same."
Remuneration,Amount,"A new minimum wage has been set in 2013 in 4 categories
ofdomesticworkers:(1)domesticservantsemployedby
Diplomats and Potential Businessmen TZS 150,000, an increase
from the previous TZS 90,000; (2) Domestic workers employed
by Entitled Government Officers TZS 130,000, an increase from
TZS 80,000; (3) Live-out domestic workers NOT employed by
employers in category (1) and (2) above TZS 80,000; and (4) Live-
in domestic workers  NOT employed by employers in categories
(1) and (2) above TZS 40,000.00. The reduction of 68 percent of
live-in domestic workers is no longer applicable. The situational
analysis found that the average pay among domestic workers
employed by diplomats ranged from TZS100,000 to 250,000
while for live-in domestic workers as low as TZS 25,000 and as
high as TZS 100,000. Average pay for live-out domestic workers
closely mirrors the minimum way for that category."
,Method,"Findings from the qualitative research on employment practices
and working conditions in Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam reveal
thatotherformsofâ€œexchangeâ€andsocialarrangements
betweentheemployer-householdandthedomesticworker
or his/her family were governing the rendering of services by
some domestic workers to private households. Food and shelter,
schooling and financial aid are some of the â€œcurrenciesâ€ at work
inthesearrangements.Theseinformalsocialarrangements
may explain the considerable proportion of domestic workers
reportedly not being remunerated."
,"Payment of
wages","Outofalldomesticworkersidentifiedbythesurvey,some
53 per cent reported being paid, in cash and/or in kind. This
proportion is similar in rural (52 per cent) and urban (53 per
cent)areas.Theshareofpaiddomesticworkersisslightly
higher among women (55 per cent) than among men (44 per
cent). The incidence of explicit remuneration for work rendered
tends to be higher among male domestic workers employed in
rural areas (85 per cent) and among female domestic workers
employed in urban areas (62 per cent)."
Working Time,"Working
Hours","Normal working hours in Tanzania are 9 hours a day, 45 a week
and not more than 6 days a week according to the Employment
andLabourRelations
Act.SimilarlyinZanzibar,thenormal
working hours are not more than 8 hours a day and not more
than 42 hours in a week according to the Employment Act of
Zanzibar. Most violations of working hours were found among
live-indomesticworkerswhereby70percentofdomestic
workers were said to work between 14 and 16 hours, while 20
percent worked between 10 and 14 hours. None of the domestic
workers reported being paid overtime."
,Rest periods,"EmploymentandLabourRelationsActof2004ofTanzania
provides for three kinds of rest periods; daily break, daily rest and
weekly rest. Provisions are also made for compulsory holidays.
Findingsofthequalitativeresearchindicatethatdomestic
workers do not have daily breaks except when the employers
are not present. Weekly rest is deemed unpredictable because
itisdependentontheemployerâ€™sdecision.Mostdomestic
workers have only been able to observe compulsory holidays
when the employer has had no visitors or children are away. A
few mentioned being paid for working over compulsory holiday,
but mostly in kind."
,Annual Leave,"70 percent of domestic workers indicated that they were never
given annual leave. This may also be evidenced by cases which
werefilledtotheConciliation,MediationandArbitration
(CMA) board in the employeeâ€™s state that their employers, on
account of termination of employment, should pay them for the
accumulated annual leave which they were never given at work."
"Social
Protection","Occupational
Safety and
Health","The Occupational Health and Safety Act of 2003 in Mainland
TanzaniaandtheOccupationalandHealthAct
of2005are
geared towards safe workplaces, which do not endanger the
health of employees. However, definition of who an employee is
and what constitutes a workplace has served to isolate domestic
workers. No evidence of households which were inspected for
the safety and health of domestic workers was found in both
mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar. Domestic workers reported
concerns on how they have to fend for themselves if injured
at work. Seemingly, most employers are yet to regard their
households as legitimate work places."
,Social Security,"Both mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar have several regulatory
framework s for social security. Three reasons have repeatedly
been cited for the lack of coverage among domestic workers:
(1) Until as recent as 2011, the operational structures of the
social security schemes did not provide for employers of five or
less employees. These schemes are still considering the huge
administrativecostsfortakingonindividualemployers;(2)
The short-term nature of domestic work contracts (as short as
three months) do not motivate employers to initiate what they
consider a cumbersome process; and (3) Domestic workers are
not willing to contribute part of their meagre salaries to these
schemes which they do not understand the working modalities."
,"Maternity
Protection","In most cases, when a live-in domestic worker gets pregnant,
she voluntarily leaves her job or is asked by the employer to
leave. A few cases were reported of employers granting unpaid
maternity leave to the domestic worker for a few days as if such
provisions are in the discretion of the employer. Notably, in
both cases, the employers are knowingly and/or unknowingly
in violation of the national labour law."
"Sectoral
Relations","Collective
Bargaining","PartVIIoftheLabourRelationsAct
andEmploymentAct
respectively(both
of2005)andPartVIoftheEmployment
andLabourRelationsAct
of2004provideallworkersand
employerinZanzibarandmainlandTanzania,respectively,
the right to collective bargaining. Notably, Zanzibar does not
have a single collective bargaining agreement in any sector to
date and mainland Tanzania has not registered any collective
bargaining agreement for any domestic worker.  The need for
the organization of both the employees and employers was
emphasized in most interviews."
,"Dispute
Resolution","A number of cases concerning domestic workers have been
registered at the Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CMA)
board as well as the labour Court in mainland Tanzania. Some
casesconcerningparticularlychildrenhavebeentreatedas
criminal cases and presented to the High Court. The Dispute
Handling Unit (DHU) in Zanzibar has just begun its functions and
to date no cases on domestic work have been registered.  Most
domestic workers do not have information on the existence
of neither the dispute handling machinery nor a trade union
representing them."
"Perceptions
on living
and working
conditions",Employers,"Employersvaluedomesticworkersinviewofthefactthat
withoutthemtheycouldaccomplishmuchoutsidethe
household. A number of employers are concerned about the
quality of domestic workers â€˜these daysâ€™ indicating nostalgic
preferences for years gone by when â€˜house girls understood
their job and what they need to do.â€™ Domestic workers are
considered unreliable, undisciplined and a necessary burden."
,Workers,"Domestic work is not valued. A number of domestic workers
request not to be addressed as domestic workers when outside
the household. Employers were often said to be unreasonable,
they did not consider â€˜house girls as human beings with feelingâ€™
and most concerning they never tell the truth about working
conditions of their domestic workers, â€˜which means they know
what they are doing when they treat us unjustly.â€™"
